# Project_ABC_Company
Introduction:
The dataset presents a comprehensive snapshot of ABC company's workforce, featuring 458 employees and nine key attributes, including 'Name', 'Team', 'Number', 'Position', 'Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'College', and 'Salary'. The goal of this analysis is to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the company's employee demographics, team structures, and salary distributions.

Preprocessing Steps:

Correction of 'Height' column: Replaced incorrect data with random numbers between 150 and 180.
Handling missing values: Filled NaN values in 'Salary' column with the mean salary. For 'College', NaN values were replaced with 'unknown'.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Objectives:

1. Team Analysis:

Identify the count of employees in each team.
Visualize the percentage split of employees across teams to understand team sizes.
2. Position Segregation:

Examine the distribution of employees across different positions.
Identify the most prevalent positions within the company.
3. Age Group Analysis:

Explore the distribution of employees' ages.
Identify the age group with the highest representation in the workforce.
4. Salary Spending Analysis:

Identify teams and positions with the highest salary spending.
Understand the distribution of salaries across different teams and positions.
5. Correlation between Age and Salary:

Visualize the scatter plot to explore any potential correlation between age and salary.
Conclusion:

Through the outlined EDA process, we aim to unravel patterns and trends within the employee dataset, offering a comprehensive view of ABC company's workforce. This analysis not only aids in understanding the current state of the company but also provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making, team optimization, and salary management.
