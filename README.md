# Project_ABC_Company
Introduction:
The dataset presents a comprehensive snapshot of ABC company's workforce, featuring 458 employees and nine key attributes, including 'Name', 'Team', 'Number', 'Position', 'Age', 'Height', 'Weight', 'College', and 'Salary'. The goal of this analysis is to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain valuable insights into the company's employee demographics, team structures, and salary distributions.

### Step 1: Importing Necessary Libraries

In this step, we import essential Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib that are crucial for data manipulation and visualization.

### Step 2: Data Loading

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, creating a structured format for further analysis.

### Step 3: Data Analysis

Initial exploration of the dataset is conducted to understand its structure, features, and general characteristics.

### Step 4: Data Preprocessing

The dataset is prepared for analysis by handling missing values and correcting data inconsistencies. This includes addressing issues like incorrect data in the 'Height' column.

### Step 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization

This step involves a deeper exploration of the dataset through various analyses and visualizations to extract meaningful insights.
#### 1.Team Analysis:

The count of employees in each team is determined.
Visual representation of the percentage split across teams aids in understanding team sizes.

#### 2.Position Segregation:

The distribution of employees across different positions is examined.
Identification of the most prevalent positions within the company is a key focus.

#### 3.Age Group Analysis:

Exploration of the distribution of employees' ages is performed.
Identification of the age group with the highest representation in the workforce is emphasized.

#### 4.Salary Spending Analysis:

Teams and positions with the highest salary spending are identified.
The distribution of salaries across different teams and positions is studied.

#### Correlation between Age and Salary:

A scatter plot is used to visually explore potential correlations between age and salary.


Through the outlined EDA process, we aim to unravel patterns and trends within the employee dataset, offering a comprehensive view of ABC company's workforce. This analysis not only aids in understanding the current state of the company but also provides valuable insights for strategic decision-making, team optimization, and salary management.
